# liri-node-app

## Project Overview

*  With node.js, we're grabbing info from the package.json and displaying the info on the terminal with command lines.
*  The info that the user needs to grab is being 'require' and stored in respective variables.
    *  Take in two arguments, first will be the action and second will be the function.
    *  Next are the four functions that correlate with the four command lines.
        *  So when the user inputs the command lines in the terminal with node.js they should have the info displayed on the terminal.
*  To run the app, the user will input node liri.js plus one of the four command lines and what they're looking for which will then display the info on the terminal.
